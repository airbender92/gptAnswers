`tsconfig.json outDir` and `webpack.config.js` output directory can potentially conflict with each other if they are set to the same directory. 

Both `outDir` and `output.path` options determine the output directory for compiled JavaScript files generated by TypeScript and webpack respectively.

To avoid conflicts, you should make sure that their output directories do not overlap, or better yet, remove the `outDir` attribute from your `tsconfig.json` file if you're already using `webpack`. 

This allows `webpack` to manage the output of the overall build process while still enabling TypeScript compilation. 

If you want to keep `outDir` in your `tsconfig.json`, you can change the directory to which the TypeScript compiler outputs its files so that it does not clash with the output directory used by `webpack`.

For instance, you could set `outDir` to a subdirectory like `./dist/ts` and use an identical output path with webpack's `output.path` option set to `./dist/webpack` to avoid overlap between the two.
