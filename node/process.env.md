Yes, after setting an environment variable using `cross-env` in your script, you can access the value of that variable in your code using `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME`.

For example, if you set the environment variable `MY_VAR` to `'hello world'` using `cross-env`, like this:

```
"scripts": {
  "start": "cross-env MY_VAR=hello world node app.js"
}
```

Then, in your Node.js application (`app.js` in this case), you can access the value of `MY_VAR` using `process.env.MY_VAR`. For instance, you can log it to the console like this:

```
console.log(process.env.MY_VAR); // output: 'hello world'
```

So, to sum up, `cross-env` is a tool for setting environment variables for scripts, and `process.env` is a built-in object in Node.js for accessing environment variables within your code. You can use them together to set and read environment variables across multiple platforms.
