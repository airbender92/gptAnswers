You can use three dashes (`---`) or three asterisks (`***`) on a new line to create a horizontal line in Markdown. Here's an example:

```
This is some text.

---

This is below the horizontal line.
```

Or using asterisks:

```
This is some text.

***

This is below the horizontal line.
```

Both of these will output:

This is some text.

---

This is below the horizontal line.
