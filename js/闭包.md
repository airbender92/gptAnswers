```js
function()
	{
		var updateListenerList = function(element, eventName, funct)
		{
			if (element.mxListenerList == null)
			{
				element.mxListenerList = [];
			}
			
			var entry = {name: eventName, f: funct};
			element.mxListenerList.push(entry);
		};
		
		if (window.addEventListener)
		{
			return function(element, eventName, funct)
			{
				element.addEventListener(eventName, funct, false);
				updateListenerList(element, eventName, funct);
			};
		}
		else
		{
			return function(element, eventName, funct)
			{
				element.attachEvent('on' + eventName, funct);
				updateListenerList(element, eventName, funct);				
			};
		}
	}()
  ```

The reason for using the immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) pattern in this example is to prevent any variables or functions declared inside it from conflicting with other variables and functions in the global scope.

When you define a variable or function outside of any function, it becomes part of the global scope. Any code in your program can access global variables and functions, which can lead to naming conflicts or unintended behavior if two or more parts of the program use the same variable name or function.

By wrapping the code inside an IIFE, we create a new scope where any variables and functions defined inside it are not accessible from outside. The returned functions created by the outer function can still access the updateListenerList function and the element.mxListenerList array, but they cannot be accessed from anywhere else in the program.

This technique is commonly used to create private variables and functions in JavaScript modules. By keeping some information private and exposing only what's needed to the outside world, we can create more robust and maintainable code.
