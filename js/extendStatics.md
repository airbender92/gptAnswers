Here's an example of the `extendStatics` method in JavaScript:

```javascript
class Parent {
  static speak() {
    console.log('Parent is speaking.');
  }
}

class Child extends Parent {
  static speak() {
    console.log('Child is speaking.');
  }
}

function extendStatics(d, b) {
  for (var p in b) if (b.hasOwnProperty(p)) d[p] = b[p];
  function __() { this.constructor = d; }
  __.prototype = b.prototype;
  d.prototype = new __();
  d._super = b.prototype;
}

extendStatics(Child, Parent);

Child.speak(); // outputs "Child is speaking."
```

In this code sample, we have two classes: `Parent` and `Child`. The `Parent` class has a `static speak` method that outputs a message to the console. 

The `Child` class extends the `Parent` class and also has its own `static speak` method that overrides the one defined in `Parent`.

The `extendStatics` function takes two parameters: `d` and `b`. `d` is the subclass that will be extended, while `b` is the superclass to be used as the basis of the extension.

Inside the `extendStatics` function, a loop goes through all the properties of `b` and copies them to `d`. Then, a new constructor is defined as `__`, which sets the `constructor` property of `d` to itself.

After that, the `__` prototype is set to the `b` prototype, creating a new object with `b` as its prototype. Finally, the prototype of `d` is set to the new `__` object.

This allows us to call the `speak` method on the `Child` class, which should output "Child is speaking."

The statement `d.prototype = new __()` creates a new object with the blueprint of the constructor function `__` and assigns it as the prototype of `d`. 

This is commonly used in JavaScript to create a prototypal inheritance relationship between two functions or objects. In this case, we are setting up `d` to be a subclass of some superclass `b`.

To better explain why this line of code is useful, let us consider the following example:

```js
function Animal(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Animal.prototype.sayName = function() {
  console.log("My name is " + this.name);
};

function Cat(name) {
  Animal.call(this, name);
}

Cat.prototype = new Animal(); 

var myCat = new Cat("Fluffy"); 
myCat.sayName(); // Output: My name is Fluffy
```

In the above example, we have two constructor functions `Animal` and `Cat`. `Cat` is a subclass of `Animal`. We can see that `Cat.prototype` is being set to a new instance of `Animal`, which means that any methods defined on `Animal.prototype` will be available on `Cat.prototype`. This allows instances of `Cat` to inherit the properties and methods from `Animal`.

Similarly, in the original code, by setting `d.prototype` to a new instance of `__`, we are setting up `d` to inherit all the properties and methods of `__` and its prototype chain, which may include properties and methods defined on the prototype of `b`.
