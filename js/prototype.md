`Object.getPrototypeOf()` is a built-in JavaScript function that returns the prototype (i.e., the internal `[[Prototype]]` property value) of a specified object. In other words, it retrieves the prototype object of any given object.

The syntax for using the `Object.getPrototypeOf()` method is simple:

```js
Object.getPrototypeOf(object)
```

Here, `object` is the object whose prototype object we want to retrieve.

For instance, consider the following example:

```js
const myObj = {};
const protoObj = { x: 10 };
Object.setPrototypeOf(myObj, protoObj);
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(myObj));
// Output: { x: 10 }
```

In this example, we first create an empty object called `myObj` and then set its prototype to a new object, `protoObj`, via `Object.setPrototypeOf()`. Finally, we log the prototype object of `myObj` by calling `Object.getPrototypeOf(myObj)`. As expected, the output is `{ x: 10 }`.

Note that `Object.getPrototypeOf()` returns `null` if the specified object has no prototype (i.e., its prototype chain ends at `Object.prototype`).
