Apologies for any confusion caused. In mxGraph version 4.2.2, `graph.insertVertex()` is not an `mxCellState`. Instead, it is a method provided by the mxGraph library to insert a new vertex (cell) into the graph model and obtain an `mxCell` object representing that vertex.

Here's the correct usage of `graph.insertVertex()` in mxGraph version 4.2.2:

```javascript
var parent = graph.getDefaultParent();
var vertex = graph.insertVertex(parent, null, 'Progress Node', 20, 20, 200, 50, 'customNode');
```

Explanation of the parameters:

- `parent`: The parent cell under which the new vertex will be inserted.
- `id`: A unique identifier for the new vertex. Pass `null` to let mxGraph generate an ID automatically.
- `value`: The value to be displayed on the vertex. It can be a simple string or an HTML representation.
- `x`: The X-coordinate of the vertex's position.
- `y`: The Y-coordinate of the vertex's position.
- `width`: The width of the vertex.
- `height`: The height of the vertex.
- `style`: A string representing the style to be applied to the vertex. It can include various properties like fill color, stroke color, font size, etc.

The `graph.insertVertex()` method returns an `mxCell` object representing the newly created vertex. An `mxCell` is an object that represents a cell in the graph model and contains information about the cell's properties, edges connected to it, and other related data.

To summarize, `graph.insertVertex()` in mxGraph version 4.2.2 is used to add a new vertex to the graph model and returns an `mxCell` object representing that vertex. It is not an `mxCellState`. The `mxCellState` is used internally by mxGraph to represent the current state of a cell in the graph view (i.e., its visual properties).
