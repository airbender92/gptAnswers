When you have a large number of stores defined in your project, importing them individually in the `stores/index.ts` file can lead to a lot of repetitive code. One way to optimize this is to use dynamic imports or lazy loading.

Dynamic imports allow you to import modules only when they are needed, instead of at the beginning of your app's execution. This means that your app will load faster because it won't have to load all your stores immediately.

Here's an example of how you can use dynamic imports to load your stores lazily:

```typescript
let stores = {};

async function loadStores() {
  const StoreA = await import('./storeA');
  const StoreB = await import('./storeB');
  const StoreC = await import('./storeC');

  stores = {
    storeA: new StoreA.default(),
    storeB: new StoreB.default(),
    storeC: new StoreC.default(),
  };
}

loadStores();

export default stores;
```

In this example, we define an empty object called `stores` and then define an async function called `loadStores`. Inside `loadStores`, we use the `import` statement to dynamically import each store module. We then add each store instance to the `stores` object as properties.

Finally, we call `loadStores()` to kick off the dynamic loading of our stores and export the `stores` object as the default export from `stores/index.ts`.

This way, when you import `stores` in other files, the `loadStores()` function will be called lazily and your app will only load the stores that are actually needed.

I hope this helps you optimize your MobX stores in a React TypeScript project!
