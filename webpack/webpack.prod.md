Of course, I'm happy to help you with that! 

When working with `webpack.production.js`, it's also common to have a separate configuration file for shared or common configuration options. In our example project, we'll again call this file `webpack.common.js`, which should contain the shared configuration between development and production mode.

Here's an example of what your `webpack.common.js` could look like:

```js
const path = require('path');
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require("html-webpack-plugin");
const MiniCssExtractPlugin = require("mini-css-extract-plugin");

module.exports = {
    entry: './src/index.jsx',
    output: {
        path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
        filename: 'bundle.[contenthash].js',
        clean: true
    },
    resolve: {
        extensions: ['.js', '.jsx']
    },
    module: {
        rules: [
            {
                test: /\.(js|jsx)$/,
                exclude: /node_modules/,
                use: ['babel-loader']
            },
            {
                test: /\.css$/,
                use: [MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader, 'css-loader']
            }
        ]
    },
    plugins: [
        new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
            template: "./public/index.html"
        }),
        new MiniCssExtractPlugin()
    ]
};
```

This configuration file sets up an entry point (`./src/index.jsx`), an output file name and directory (`bundle.[contenthash].js` and `./dist`, respectively), specifies how JavaScript files should be processed by the `babel-loader` loader, and includes the `HtmlWebpackPlugin` plugin that creates an `index.html` file based on our `public/index.html` template.

It also includes the `MiniCssExtractPlugin` plugin, which extracts CSS into separate files instead of bundling it in the JavaScript files.

Now let's take a look at how we can merge the common configuration into our `webpack.production.js` file:

```js
const { merge } = require("webpack-merge");
const common = require("./webpack.common.js");

module.exports = merge(common, {
    mode: 'production',
    optimization: {
        minimize: true
    }
});
```

In this updated `webpack.production.js` file, we again use the `merge` function from the `webpack-merge` package to merge the `common` configuration object into our `production` configuration object.

Then, we're overriding the `mode` option to be set to `'production'`, and adding an `optimization` object with a boolean property of `minimize` set to `true`. This tells webpack to minify the code in production mode.

That's all! You have now successfully merged your `webpack.common.js` configuration file into your `webpack.production.js` configuration file. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
