`DefinePlugin` is a built-in plugin in Webpack that allows you to define global constants that can be used in your code. These constants can be either string literals or expressions.

Here's an example of how you might use `DefinePlugin` in your Webpack configuration:

```javascript
const webpack = require('webpack');

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: __dirname + '/dist'
  },
  plugins: [
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
      API_URL: JSON.stringify('https://api.example.com'),
      VERSION: JSON.stringify(require('./package.json').version)
    })
  ]
};
```

In this example, we're using `DefinePlugin` to define two global constants: `API_URL` and `VERSION`. The values of these constants are specified as string literals (wrapped in `JSON.stringify()`), but they could also be expressions.

Now, in our code, we can reference these constants like so:

```javascript
console.log(API_URL); // logs "https://api.example.com"
console.log(VERSION); // logs the version number from package.json
```

This can be useful for a variety of purposes, such as defining different behavior based on whether your code is running in development or production mode, or providing configuration options to your code at build time.

I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any additional questions.
