The command `webpack -p --config=webpack.config.prod.js` is used to build a production-ready version of your application using Webpack. 

Here's what each part means:

- `webpack`: This runs the Webpack module bundler, which takes all of your application's JavaScript modules and compiles them into a single file (or a set of files) that can be used in the browser.
- `-p`: This is a shortcut for `--optimize-minimize --define process.env.NODE_ENV="production"`. It tells Webpack to apply optimizations that are specific to production environments, such as minifying and compressing the output file(s).
- `--config=webpack.config.prod.js`: This tells Webpack to use the specified configuration file when building your application. In this case, it's `webpack.config.prod.js`, which should contain settings and options that are specific to production builds.

So when you run this command, you're essentially telling Webpack to build a production-ready version of your application with optimizations and settings that are specific to production environments.
