Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that.

When working with `webpack.development.js`, it's common to have a separate configuration file for shared or common configuration options. In our example project, we'll call this file `webpack.common.js`.

Here's an example of what your `webpack.common.js` could look like:

```js
const path = require('path');
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.tsx',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist')
  },
  resolve: {
    extensions: ['.ts', '.tsx', '.js']
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.tsx?$/,
        use: 'ts-loader',
        exclude: /node_modules/
      }
    ]
  },
  plugins: [
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      template: './public/index.html'
    })
  ]
};
```

This configuration file sets up an entry point (`./src/index.tsx`), an output file name and directory (`bundle.js` and `./dist`, respectively), and specifies how TypeScript files should be processed by the `ts-loader` loader.

It also includes the `HtmlWebpackPlugin` plugin, which generates an `index.html` file based on our `public/index.html` template.

Now let's take a look at how we can merge this common configuration into our `webpack.development.js` file:

```js
const path = require('path');
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');
const { merge } = require('webpack-merge');
const common = require('./webpack.common.js');

module.exports = merge(common, {
  mode: 'development',
  devtool: 'inline-source-map',
  output: {
    publicPath: '/'
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.less$/,
        use: [
          'style-loader',
          'css-loader',
          'less-loader'
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  devServer: {
    contentBase: './dist',
    open: true
  }
});
```

In this updated `webpack.development.js` file, we first import the `merge` function from the `webpack-merge` package, as well as the `common` configuration object from our `webpack.common.js` file.

Then, using the `merge` function, we merge the `common` configuration object into our `development` configuration object. This means that any options specified in both `common` and `development` will be overridden by the values in `development`.

In this case, we're overriding the `mode`, `devtool`, `output.publicPath` (which sets the URL path for all assets), and `module.rules` (to include the LESS loader). We're also adding a new `devServer` option to specify how the Webpack development server should behave.

That's it! With these changes, your project should now be properly configured to use both `webpack.common.js` and `webpack.development.js`. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
