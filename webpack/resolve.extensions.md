`resolve.extensions` is an option in Webpack that specifies the extensions of files that Webpack should try when resolving modules. 

When you `import` or `require` a module, Webpack will look for this file name first. If it can’t find the exact filename, it will append extensions to the filename and search for those files. The order of searching is defined by `resolve.extensions`.

For example, if `resolve.extensions` is set to `['.js', '.json']`, then when you import `example`, Webpack will first look for a file named `example.js`. If that’s not found, it will look for `example.json`. If neither of these files is found, Webpack will throw an error.

By default, the following extensions are already included in `resolve.extensions`: `['.wasm', '.mjs', '.js', '.json']`.

You can add additional file extensions to `resolve.extensions` using an array of strings. For example, if you want to include `.jsx` and `.ts` files, you would add them as follows:

```javascript
resolve: {
  extensions: ['.wasm', '.mjs', '.js', '.json', '.jsx', '.ts']
}
```

This will tell Webpack to also look for files with the extensions `.jsx` and `.ts` when resolving modules.
