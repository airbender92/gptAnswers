`fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin` is a Webpack plugin that runs TypeScript type checking on a separate process, allowing Webpack to continue its bundling process without waiting for type checking to complete. 

Without this plugin, when you're using TypeScript with Webpack, the type checking will be performed on the main thread, which can slow down your build times since type checking can take a while and block other Webpack operations. It can also cause problems if your TypeScript project has circular dependencies, as the type checker tries to process all the files at once.

By running the type checking in a separate process, `fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin` avoids these issues and makes builds faster and more efficient. The plugin also uses caching to speed up subsequent builds, only re-checking files that have been modified since the last build.

To use `fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin`, you need to install it via npm (`npm install --save-dev fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin`) and then add it to your webpack configuration file as a plugin. Here's an example of how to use it:

```javascript
const ForkTsCheckerWebpackPlugin = require('fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
  // ...other Webpack options...
  plugins: [
    new ForkTsCheckerWebpackPlugin()
    // ...other plugins...
  ]
}
```

This will run the type checker as a separate process when you build your project with Webpack. You can also configure the plugin with various options to customize its behavior, such as specifying the path to your TypeScript config file or changing the number of workers used for type checking.
