If the `webpack config` alias for `"@"` path is not working properly within React components, it could be because the Webpack configuration is not properly set up to handle aliases in TypeScript.

To fix this issue, you can add the following lines of code to your `tsconfig.json` file:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["src/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

This tells TypeScript that any import that starts with `"@/"` should resolve to files within the `"src/"` directory. 

Then, add the following line to your `webpack.config.js` file to link to the `baseUrl` specified in the `tsconfig.json` file:

```javascript
resolve: {
  extensions: ['.js', '.jsx', '.ts', '.tsx'],
  alias: {
    '@': path.resolve(__dirname, '../src'),
  },
},
```
This should enable you to use the alias defined in the Webpack configuration within your React components.
