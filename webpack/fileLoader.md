```js
{
        test: /\.(png|jpe?g|gif)$/i,
        use: [
          {
            loader: 'file-loader',
            options: {
              name: '[name].[ext]',
              outputPath: 'images/'
            }
          }
        ]
      }

This is a configuration object for Webpack that specifies how to handle files with certain extensions such as .png, .jpg, .jpeg and .gif. 

The `test` property is a regular expression that matches against the file extension of the file being imported or required in your code. In this case, it will match any files that have extensions of .png, .jpg, .jpeg or .gif.

The `use` property defines an array of loaders (or transformations) that should be applied to the matching files. In this case, there is one loader defined called `file-loader`, which will copy the matched files to your output directory and generate a relative URL to each of them.

The `options` property is an object that is passed along to the loader, specificying its configuration. Here, we define the following options for the `file-loader`: 

- `name`: This option determines the filename and extension of the copied file. We use `[name].[ext]` to preserve the original filename and extension.
- `outputPath`: This option determines the destination directory where the files will be saved. Here, we specify that all images should be saved in the 'images' subdirectory of our output folder.
