Here is an example `.eslintrc.json` configuration file for a React, MobX, TypeScript and Less project that extends the recommended configurations for TypeScript and React plugins, and includes rules for MobX and Less:

```json
{
  "extends": [
    "eslint:recommended",
    "plugin:react/recommended",
    "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended"
  ],
  "parser": "@typescript-eslint/parser",
  "plugins": ["@typescript-eslint", "react", "mobx", "react-hooks"],
  "env": {
    "browser": true,
    "es6": true
  },
  "settings": {
    "react": {
      "version": "detect"
    }
  },
  "rules": {
    "react/prop-types": "off",
    "react-hooks/rules-of-hooks": "error",
    "react-hooks/exhaustive-deps": "warn",
    "@typescript-eslint/explicit-function-return-type": "off",
    "@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any": "off",
    "@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars": [
      "error",
      { "ignoreRestSiblings": true }
    ],
    "mobx/no-observable-array-length": "error",
    "mobx/no-observable-object-injection": "error",
    "mobx/require-array-sort-compare": "error",
    "no-console": "warn"
  }
}
```

This configuration includes the TypeScript, React, MobX, and React Hooks plugins, sets the parser to `@typescript-eslint/parser`, and configures the environment to allow ES6 syntax in browsers. Additionally, it defines some rules for each plugin, such as disabling prop-types for React, enabling rules for React Hooks, and specifying some best practices and error-prevention rules for MobX.

Please note that the rules included in this configuration are not exhaustive and should be adjusted to meet your specific needs and preferences.
