Sure, here is a detailed explanation of each property in the [configuration object](./eslintrc.md):

- `extends`: Extends the default recommended rules from ESLint and includes additional rules from plugins for React and TypeScript. It ensures that these rules are applied to your codebase.

- `parser`: Specifies the parser that should be used to parse the code. In this case, it's @typescript-eslint/parser, which is a parser that understands TypeScript syntax.

- `plugins`: Lists the additional ESLint plugins used for checking code. Plugins included here are @typescript-eslint, react, mobx and react-hooks.

- `env`: Sets global variables that are predefined by the environment. This includes specifying that the code is running in the browser and supports ES6 language features.

- `settings`: Defines settings for some plugins. For instance, it specifies the version of React that is in use so that other plugins can validate React-related configurations or extensions.

- `rules`: This is where you specify the rules that must be followed while writing code. Rules can be specified to turn off certain checks (`"react/prop-types": "off"`), set them to warn (`"mobx/no-observable-array-length": "warn"`) or error out if they are violated (`"react-hooks/rules-of-hooks": "error"`).

The different rule settings in the `"rules"` object include:
- `"react/prop-types": "off"`: Disabling of prop-types check in React components.
- `"react-hooks/rules-of-hooks": "error"`: Making sure that React hooks are properly used.
- `"react-hooks/exhaustive-deps": "warn"`: This warns when dependencies of useEffect or useCallback hooks are not exhaustive.
- `"@typescript-eslint/explicit-function-return-type": "off"`: Not requiring developers to always type return values of functions in Typescript
- `"@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any": "off"`: Allowing values to be of "any" type.
- `"@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars": ["error", {"ignoreRestSiblings": true}]`: Detecting when there are unused variables in code but ignoring rest siblings.
- `"mobx/no-observable-array-length": "error"`: Disallowing length property assignment or reassignment on observable arrays.
- `"mobx/no-observable-object-injection": "error"`: Rrequired to observe access to observable objectsâ€™ properties and forbids modifying them.
- `"mobx/require-array-sort-compare": "error"`: Enforcing array.sort() compare function usage for MobX observable arrays.
- `"no-console": "warn"`: Warning against using console.log().
