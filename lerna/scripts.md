`lerna clean` is a command provided by Lerna, a tool for managing JavaScript projects with multiple packages or modules in a single repository, typically known as monorepos. This command is used to clean up the `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` files in all the packages within your monorepo.

When you run `lerna clean`, it does the following:

1. Removes the `node_modules` directory: It goes into each package within your monorepo and deletes the `node_modules` directory. This directory contains all the dependencies for that package. Running this command can help free up disk space and ensure that your project starts with a clean slate regarding dependencies.

2. Deletes the `package-lock.json` file: It also removes the `package-lock.json` file from each package. This file is used to lock down the versions of dependencies in a package to ensure consistency across different development environments. Removing it means that the dependencies will be resolved again when you run `npm install` or `yarn install` in a package.

This command can be helpful in scenarios where you want to start fresh with your project's dependencies or ensure that your monorepo's packages have consistent and up-to-date dependencies. However, it's essential to be cautious when using `lerna clean` as it will remove dependencies, and you'll need to reinstall them if you plan to continue working on the project. Make sure to back up any important data before running this command, and use it with care.





`lerna run build` is a command provided by Lerna, a tool for managing JavaScript projects with multiple packages or modules in a single repository, often referred to as monorepos. This command allows you to run a specified script called "build" in all packages within your monorepo.

Here's how it works:

1. **Lerna Context**: First, Lerna determines the packages in your monorepo that have a "build" script defined in their respective `package.json` files.

2. **Execution**: It then executes the "build" script in each of these packages one by one. The exact behavior of the "build" script depends on how it's defined in each package's `package.json` file. Typically, the "build" script is used to compile, transpile, or bundle the package's source code into a distributable format.

3. **Sequential Execution**: By default, `lerna run build` runs these scripts sequentially, meaning it will start and finish building one package before moving on to the next. This can be useful when dependencies between packages need to be considered during the build process.

4. **Parallel Execution**: You can also specify the `--parallel` flag to run the "build" scripts in parallel, potentially speeding up the build process. However, this should be used with caution, especially if there are shared resources or dependencies that could lead to conflicts when building multiple packages simultaneously.

For example, if you have a monorepo with multiple packages and each package has a "build" script defined in its `package.json` file, running `lerna run build` will execute the "build" script for each package in the order specified by Lerna.

This command is valuable when you want to automate the build process for all packages in your monorepo, ensuring that they are all built consistently and in the correct order, whether it involves compiling TypeScript code, bundling JavaScript, or performing other build-related tasks.





`lerna run types` is a command you can use with Lerna in a monorepo (a JavaScript project with multiple packages/modules within a single repository) to execute a script called "types" in each package that defines this script in its `package.json` file.

Here's how it works:

1. **Lerna Context**: Lerna identifies the packages in your monorepo that have a "types" script defined in their respective `package.json` files.

2. **Execution**: It then executes the "types" script in each of these packages one by one. The exact behavior of the "types" script depends on how it's defined in each package's `package.json` file. Typically, the "types" script is used to generate TypeScript declaration files (`.d.ts`) or perform other type-related tasks.

3. **Sequential Execution**: By default, `lerna run types` runs these scripts sequentially, meaning it will start and finish executing the "types" script for one package before moving on to the next. This can be useful when dependencies between packages need to be considered during the type generation process.

4. **Parallel Execution**: You can also specify the `--parallel` flag to run the "types" scripts in parallel, potentially speeding up the type generation process. However, this should be used with caution, especially if there are shared resources or dependencies that could lead to conflicts when generating types for multiple packages simultaneously.

The specific purpose of the "types" script can vary from package to package. Common use cases include generating TypeScript declaration files from source code, ensuring type definitions are up to date, or performing type-related checks.

For example, if you have a monorepo with multiple packages, and some packages have a "types" script defined in their `package.json`, running `lerna run types` would execute the "types" script for each package, potentially generating TypeScript declaration files or performing other type-related tasks for those packages.

This command is valuable when you want to automate type-related tasks across all packages in your monorepo, ensuring consistent and up-to-date type definitions throughout your project.





`git-cz` is a command-line tool that provides an interactive and user-friendly interface for creating commit messages following the conventional commit message format. It is typically used in software development projects to enforce a consistent and standardized way of writing commit messages, making it easier to track and understand changes in a codebase.

Here's how `git-cz` works and what it's commonly used for:

1. **Conventional Commit Messages**: `git-cz` guides developers in writing commit messages according to a convention, typically the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). This convention defines a structured format for commit messages that includes a type, an optional scope, and a message. For example:

   ```
   feat(user-auth): add password reset functionality
   ```

   In this example, "feat" is the type, "user-auth" is the scope, and "add password reset functionality" is the message.

2. **Interactive CLI**: When you run `git-cz`, it launches an interactive command-line interface (CLI) that prompts you to provide the necessary information for your commit message, such as type, scope, and message. It may also ask for other details like breaking changes or issues references.

3. **Commit Message Templates**: `git-cz` often uses predefined commit message templates that help developers follow the commit message convention. These templates guide you in structuring your commit messages correctly.

4. **Enforcing Consistency**: By using `git-cz` or similar tools, development teams can enforce commit message consistency across the project. This makes it easier to automate tasks such as generating changelogs and tracking issues and pull requests.

5. **Integration with Git Hooks**: `git-cz` can be integrated with Git hooks to ensure that developers follow the commit message convention before committing changes. This helps catch and prevent poorly formatted commit messages.

6. **Changelog Generation**: Conventional commit messages are often used in conjunction with tools that generate changelogs automatically based on commit history. This makes it easier for teams to communicate changes to users and contributors.

Here's a typical workflow for using `git-cz`:

1. Install `git-cz` as a development dependency in your project.

2. Configure your project to use `git-cz` as the commit message interface.

3. When you're ready to commit changes, run `git-cz` instead of `git commit`. This will prompt you to provide the necessary information for your commit message.

4. Once you've completed the prompts, `git-cz` will generate a commit message following the convention and create the commit.

By using `git-cz`, development teams can maintain a clean and well-structured commit history, making it easier to understand, track, and manage code changes over time.
