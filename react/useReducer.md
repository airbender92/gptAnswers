Yes, it is possible to use the same reducer multiple times within a component by isolating state management. 

When you isolate state management within a component, you can create multiple instances of the same reducer function, each with its own piece of isolated state. This allows you to manage state independently for different parts of your UI, while still using the same reducer logic.

Here's an example of how you might use the same reducer multiple times within a component:

```jsx
import React, { useReducer } from 'react';

const initialState = { count: 0 };

// Define a reducer function to handle updates to the state
function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'decrement':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      throw new Error();
  }
}

function Counter() {
  // Create two instances of the reducer, each with its own piece of isolated state
  const [state1, dispatch1] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
  const [state2, dispatch2] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Counter 1: {state1.count}</h2>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch1({ type: 'increment' })}>+</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch1({ type: 'decrement' })}>-</button>

      <h2>Counter 2: {state2.count}</h2>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch2({ type: 'increment' })}>+</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch2({ type: 'decrement' })}>-</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, we're creating two instances of the same `reducer` function, each with their own piece of isolated state. We can then use these instances to manage different parts of our UI independently.

As you click the buttons in each section, the corresponding state will update independently without affecting the other instance of the reducer.
