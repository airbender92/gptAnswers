This error message is indicating that `react-hot-loader` has a peer dependency on `react` version `15.x.x`, `16.x.x`, or `17.x.x`.

It's possible that your current version of `react` does not satisfy this requirement, so you should check the installed version by running `npm list react`. 

To fix this issue, you can try either of the following solutions:

1. Upgrade/downgrade your `react` version to match one of the compatible versions specified in the error message. For example, if you have `react@14.0.0` installed, you can upgrade it to `^15.0.0` using the command `npm install react@^15.0.0`.

2. Alternatively, you can install a specific version of `react-hot-loader` that is compatible with your current `react` version. You can try `react-hot-loader@3.1.3` which supports `react` versions from `0.14.0` up to `16.x.x`.

To install this specific version of `react-hot-loader`, run the following command:

```console
npm install react-hot-loader@3.1.3 --save-dev
```

After installing this version, make sure to update your configuration and code according to its API.
