When working on a complicated React project, there are several things that you need to keep in mind:

1. Project Structure: It is important to have a well-organized project structure with components, assets, and other necessary files placed in relevant folders.

2. Scalability: The application must be scalable, meaning it should be able to handle an increasing amount of data or users as the application grows.

3. State Management: Managing state in complex applications can be challenging; therefore, you should choose an appropriate state management technique for your application like Redux or Context API.

4. Performance: In bigger projects, performance issues are likely to occur. You need to ensure that you follow best practices like using pure components, memoization, code splitting, and optimizing rendering cycles.

5. Testing: Testing is critical for complex applications. You should write unit tests for every component and integration tests for each feature to ensure quality and avoid regressions.

6. Security: Security should be kept in mind throughout the development cycle. You should take measures like sanitizing user input, implementing authentication, and avoiding hard-coded credentials.

7. Accessibility: Your application needs to be accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. You can use tools like axe-core to test accessibility issues in your application.

By keeping these considerations in mind, you can develop a robust and scalable React project while maintaining code quality and security.
