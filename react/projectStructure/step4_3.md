In Babel, presets are sets of transpilation rules that can be applied to your code. Presets are a convenient way to get up and running with Babel quickly. The `@babel/preset-env` and `@babel/preset-react` presets are two commonly used presets.

The `@babel/preset-env` preset is used to transpile modern JavaScript code down to an older version of JavaScript that's compatible with more browsers. It determines which plugins are necessary based on the language features you're using and the browsers you want to support.

The `@babel/preset-react` preset provides support for JSX syntax used in React components, transforming it into regular function calls.

When working with Babel, you generally configure it in a `.babelrc` file in the root directory of your project. Here's an example of how you might configure Babel to use both the `@babel/preset-env` and `@babel/preset-react` presets:

```json
{
  "presets": [
    "@babel/preset-env",
    "@babel/preset-react"
  ]
}
```

This configuration would transpile both modern JavaScript and JSX syntax to a format supported by most browsers.

Keep in mind that presets are just a way to simplify Babel configuration. You can also configure Babel manually using individual plugins instead of presets if you prefer.
