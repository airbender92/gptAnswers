I'm happy to help you with a demo of a complicated React TypeScript MobX LESS project that uses `webpack.develop.js`! Here's an example of what your project structure could look like:

```
my-app/
├── dist/
├── node_modules/
├── public/
│   ├── favicon.ico
│   ├── index.html
│   └── manifest.json
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── App.tsx
│   ├── stores/
│   │   └── counterStore.ts
│   ├── styles/
│   │   └── main.less
│   ├── index.tsx
│   └── index.less
├── webpack.develop.js
└── package.json
```

In this example project, we have the following:

- A `public` directory containing static assets like `index.html`, `favicon.ico`, and `manifest.json`.
- A `src` directory containing our entire application.
  - Within `src`, we have a `components` directory for all our React components, a `stores` directory for our MobX stores, and a `styles` directory for all our LESS styles.
  - The entry point for our application is `index.tsx`, which imports our main component (`App`) and renders it onto the DOM using React.
  - We also have an `index.less` file, which imports our main LESS stylesheet (`main.less`).
- A `webpack.develop.js` file that contains our Webpack configuration specific to development builds.
- A `package.json` file that manages our project dependencies.

Now let's take a closer look at each of these files and how they work together.

#### `public/index.html`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>My App</title>
    <link rel="shortcut icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script src="./bundle.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

This is a basic `index.html` file that sets up our application's root DOM element (`#root`) and includes our bundled JavaScript file (`bundle.js`) produced by Webpack.

#### `src/components/App.tsx`

```tsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { observer } from 'mobx-react';
import counterStore from '../stores/counterStore';

@observer
class App extends Component {
  increment = () => {
    counterStore.increment();
  };

  decrement = () => {
    counterStore.decrement();
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <p>Count: {counterStore.count}</p>
        <button onClick={this.increment}>+</button>
        <button onClick={this.decrement}>-</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

This is a simple example of a React component (`App`) that renders a message and a count, along with buttons to increment and decrement the count. The component is also decorated with the `observer` higher-order component provided by MobX, which allows it to reactively update whenever the underlying `counterStore` changes.

#### `src/stores/counterStore.ts`

```ts
import { observable, action } from 'mobx';

class CounterStore {
  @observable count = 0;

  @action.bound
  increment() {
    this.count++;
  }

  @action.bound
  decrement() {
    this.count--;
  }
}

const counterStore = new CounterStore();

export default counterStore;
```

This is a simple example of a MobX store (`CounterStore`) that contains a single observable property (`count`) and two actions (`increment` and `decrement`) that modify it. The class is exported as a singleton instance so that it can be easily imported and used throughout the application.

#### `src/styles/main.less`

```less
@primary-color: #007bff;

h1 {
  color: @primary-color;
}
```

This is a simple example of a LESS stylesheet that defines a primary color variable and styles the `<h1>` element accordingly. It is imported into our main `index.less` file.

#### `src/index.tsx`

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { render } from 'react-dom';
import App from './components/App';

import './index.less';

render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

This is our main entry point file for the application. It imports our main React component (`App`) and renders it onto the DOM using React. It also imports our main LESS stylesheet (`index.less`).

#### `webpack.develop.js`

```js
const path = require('path');
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');
const MiniCssExtractPlugin = require('mini-css-extract-plugin');

module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  devtool: 'inline-source-map',
  entry: './src/index.tsx',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist')
  },
  resolve: {
    extensions: ['.ts', '.tsx', '.js']
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.tsx?$/,
        use: 'ts-loader',
        exclude: /node_modules/
      },
      {
        test: /\.less$/,
        use: [
          MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader,
          'css-loader',
          'less-loader'
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  plugins: [
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      template: './public/index.html'
    }),
    new MiniCssExtractPlugin({
      filename: '[name].css'
    })
  ],
  devServer: {
    contentBase: path.join(__dirname, 'dist'),
    compress: true,
    port: 9000
  }
};
```

This is our Webpack configuration file for development builds. It exports an object containing various configuration options:

- `mode`: Tells Webpack which mode to build in (either `development` or `production`).
- `devtool`: Specifies the level of source map detail to include in the output JavaScript bundle.
- `entry`: Specifies the entry point for our application (`./src/index.tsx` in this case).
- `output`: Specifies the output file name (`bundle.js`) and directory (`./dist`) for our bundled JavaScript file.
- `resolve`: Specifies which file extensions Webpack should look for when resolving modules to import.
- `module`: Specifies how different file types (e.g., `.tsx?`, `.less`) should be processed by loaders before being included in the bundle.
- `plugins`: Specifies which plugins should be used by Webpack during the build process. We're using `HtmlWebpackPlugin` to generate an `index.html` file based on our `public/index.html` file and `MiniCssExtractPlugin` to extract our LESS styles into a separate CSS file.
- `devServer`: Specifies configuration options for the Webpack development server.

To run your project, you can use the following command in your terminal:

```
npm start
```

This will start up the Webpack development server, which will serve your application at `http://localhost:9000`. You can then open that URL in a web browser to see your application in action!
